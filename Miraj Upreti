our life is became easier by chemical reaction. Any things happen in our life by chemical reaction such as rush in iron,became carbondioxide gas by burning carbon compund.

<h2>In above figure you can saw the laboratory preparation of carbondioxide gas</h2>
carbondioxide gas is prepare in laboratory by reacting calcium carbonate with dilute hydrochloric acid.
CaCO<sub>3</sub>+dil 2HCL=CaCl<sub>2</sub>+H<sub>2</sub>O+CO<sub>2</sub>.
<h2>Laboratory preparation of ammonia gas</h2>
Ammonia gas is prepared in laboratory by reacting ammonium chloride and calcium hydroxide in the ratio of 2:1.

<h2>ACID RAIN</h2>
Those gases that react with oxygen and fall as droplets is called acid rain.
